# Face Generation using DCGANs

This repo contains my solution of Machine Learning Deployment project of the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree™️](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) program.

**Please check out Udacity's original repo [here](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/Project)**

## Project Overview

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, should provide enough background.
